        Tool Description:
Use this tool to send well-formatted professional emails. The email should:

Support recipient email, subject (with emojis if suitable), and body.

Format the body with proper paragraphs and line breaks.

Use HTML tags (e.g., <b> for bold) instead of markdown formatting.

Add emojis for good vibes when appropriate.

End with a natural email closing/complimentary close (e.g., Regards, Best wishes, Warmly, Cheers, etc.) followed by the senderâ€™s name or role.

Ensure the email body looks like a proper email in mail clients, not raw markdown.
